How to do it

Common mistakes


- Proven effective to catch bugs and bad patterns early
  +If you think your code is free of bugs and doesn't need review, you are arrogant, wrong, and hurting your team
- Knowledge sharing, eliminate bottleneck developers
- Natural facilitator of good practices, standards, high quality
  + Fun fact: quality -> cost savings
  + Peer review -> peer pressure

When is it not practical?

- During big bang development phases
  + Cannot, and should not be control. However, such phases should be the exception, not the norm
- In a cowboy team
  + Discipline, professionalism, humility are required
- Without supporting tools
  + Many tools exist to help doing code reviews efficiently, it would be a waste not to take benefit

Required development style

- Incremental changes
  + The project advances through small and stable logical steps = feature branches
- Good practices of commits
  + A feature advances through small and stable logical steps
  + One commit = one logical change
  + No garbage changes in commits (review the diff!)
- Good practices of branch management
  + One branch = one high level logical change
- Desire for good practices of programming
  + Humility, see chapter 33 of Code Complete
- What are the "good practices", really?
  + Code Complete is a good baseline
  + Find the best sellers for your language
  + Answer questions on Code Review: Google code review and feel lucky. Don't be afraid to be wrong. Don't be afraid to fail. It's OK to make mistakes. The failure is not to learn from them

Notably:

- Messy code is hard to review
- A mixture of unrelated changes is hard to review
- A mixture of cosmetic changes and significant changes is hard to review
- A mixture of line ending changes and significant changes is *too hard* to review
- A gigantic set of changes is *too hard* to review
- A tiny set of changes is annoying to review
- Garbage changes are a waste of time to review

Tip: self-review first. Try to be objective, honest, and count the WTFs. Make corrections, re-review, iterate until the WTF counter is zero. (That's the bare minimum. Ideally you should make your code as good as you possibly can before asking for a review.)

What to review?

- Clarity: the code should be clear, easy to read, easy to understand
- Bugs: if you see something suspicious, ask for verification
- Common bad practices
- Focus on the changes, not on the existing code surrounding it

How deep and thorough?

- There's no absolute rule
- No need to go too deep
- Don't spend too much time on a review
  + don't slow down development
  + don't risk merge conflicts
- Don't spend too little time on a review

Attitude

- A review is *not* about people. It's about the code. Repetition!
- A review is *not* an evaluation of the author. It's about the code. Repetition!
- Give constructive criticism of the code, not of the person who wrote it.
- Don't just say that something is "wrong". Suggest an alternative to make it better. Unless it's obviously wrong.
- Receive constructive criticism well. Be open to learn something new.
- Be flexible. Important!
  + The code doesn't have to be perfect
  + The goal is to make it good enough
  + If the discussion gets long, let it go, don't block progress
- Mindset of the reviewer. Be civil and respectful. Don't talk down to the author. Don't be a pain in the ass. Be open to the possibility that you might be wrong. It's OK to be wrong and make mistakes. It's not OK to not learn from them
- Keep in mind that writing the code is the harder part, picking on it is the easier

Humility in review attitude, assume that you can be wrong and the other guy might know something you don't, be open minded to learn something new

Practice on code review se, in your free time

from @holman, quote this and link to it
- chat is inherently asynchronous
- tapping me on the shoulder is inherently being a jerk
- scheduling a meeting is inherently probably a hate crime
